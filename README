Organization:

Aero_PS2_Controller - Contains a python script used to take inputs from a Logitech Dual Action game pad controller and send commands to the Aero_Remote.

Aero_Quad_X - Contains a modified version of AeroQuad version 3 available from http://www.aeroquad.com/

Aero_Remote - Contains an Arduino program to read gamepad controller inputs over Serial from a computer and send them to the Aero_Quad_X wirelessly.  Also provides functions for remote PID adjustments.

Arduino_Uno - Contains core libraries for the Arduino Uno.

copter_control - Contains a small Arduino program to run four copter motors as directed wireless by copter_remote.

copter_libs - Contains libraries for the wireless radio, and the Arduino SPI and Servo libraries. Libraries in this folder are used only by copter_control and copter_remote. Aero_Quad_X and Aero_Remote libraries are found in Aero_Quad_X/libraries.

copter_remote - Contains as small Arduino program to read Serial commands from a computer and send motor commands to a quadcopter running copter_control.
